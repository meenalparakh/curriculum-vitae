## Key Projects
- [Object Segmentation at a Distance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w2DTYCwb1F-zNjG9VN_zUwCbnVA2Fj5w/view?usp=sharing): We often need the ability to detect and segment objects that lie at a distance from a camera; for example, in a home environment, a robot should be able to identify various tabletop objects from a distance. However, current datasets do not focus on detecting small tabletop objects and hand labeling such datasets is cumbersome. We extend the previous approaches in detecting tabletop objects, which used plane segmentation and clustering, to obtain the instance masks for objects at varying distances from the camera, and provide a dataset generated using this approach. We show that a MaskRCNN model trained on such a dataset is able to segment far objects in the scene with more accuracy as compared to a baseline we propose.

- [How Languages Grow?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uPJZO-29Sq4ErGGz2ROfrCpSaaymmV3/view?usp=sharing): This paper explores how languages grow, in particular, how the number of words of a given length in a language increases as word length increases. To approach this question, we develop a graphing technique for languages and then use the properties of these graphs to identify when languages have polynomial or exponential growth rates. We also analyze empirical results to establish ideas for a future study about which aspects of a language contribute to the languageâ€™s growth rate.
